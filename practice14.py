# Q2)  Maximum Sum of Elements Less Than 
# or Equal to Given Limit 
# Problem Statement 
# You are given: 
# • 
# An array of integers of size n  
# • 
# An integer maxSum (maximum allowed 
# sum)  
# Find the maximum possible sum of 
# elements from the array such that the sum 
# is less than or equal to maxSum. 
# You can choose any subset of elements. 
 
# Task 
# Return the maximum sum ≤ maxSum. 
 
# Input 
# • 
# Integer n (size of array)  
 
 
# • 
# Array arr[n]  
# • 
# Integer maxSum  
# Output 
# • 
# Maximum possible sum ≤ maxSum  
 
# Test Cases 
# Test Case 1 
# Input: 
# n = 4 
# arr = [2, 3, 5, 7] 
# maxSum = 10 
# Output: 
# 10 
# Explanation: subset {3, 7} gives sum 10. 
 
# Test Case 2 
# Input: 
# n = 3 
# arr = [4, 8, 6] 
# maxSum = 9 
 
 
# Output: 
# 8 
# Explanation: best subset is {8}. 
 
# Approach (Brute Force) 
# • 
# Generate all subsets  
# • 
# Compute sum for each subset  
# • 
# Track maximum sum ≤ maxSum
