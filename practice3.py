# Question 1: Total Marks of a Student 
# Problem Statement 
# You are given a 2D matrix representing 
# marks of students. Each row represents a 
# student, and each column represents marks 
# in exams: 
# Column 0 → Internal exam marks  
# • 
# • 
# Column 1 → External exam marks  
# You are also given an index (i, j) 
# representing a student’s position in the 
# matrix. 
# Task 
# Calculate the total marks (internal + 
# external) of the student at the given index. 
# Input Explanation 
 
 
# 1.Two integers R and C representing 
# number of rows and columns.  
# 2.A 2D matrix of size R × C containing 
# marks.  
# 3.Two integers i and j representing the 
# index of the student.  
# Note: Even though both i and j are given, 
# the student is identified by row i. The 
# marks are taken from column 0 and column 
# 1. 
 
# Output Explanation 
# • 
# Print the sum of internal and external 
# marks of the selected student.  
# • 
# If the index is invalid (out of bounds), 
# print "Invalid Input".  
 
# Example 
# Input 
 
 
# 2 2 
# 40 50 
# 30 60 
# 1 1 
# Explanation 
# • 
# Matrix: 
# [40 50] 
# [30 60] 
# • 
# Student at index (1,1) → row = 1  
# • 
# Internal = 30, External = 60  
# • 
# Total = 30 + 60 = 90  
# Output 
# 90
