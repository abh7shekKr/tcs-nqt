# Question 2) Minimum Row Sum with Cost Replacement 
# Problem Statement: 
# You are given: 
# • An integer n  
# • An array cost[] of size n  
# • An n × n symmetric matrix where diagonal elements 
# are 0  
# For each row: 
# • Replace the diagonal element (0) with cost[i]  
# • Compute the sum of that row  
# Return the minimum row sum among all rows. 
# Input Format: 
# • First line: Integer n  
# • Second line: n space-separated integers (cost array)  
 
 
# • Next n lines: n integers each (matrix)  
# Output Format: 
# • Single integer → minimum row sum  
# Example: 
# Input: 
# 3 
# 5 6 7 
# 0 1 3 
# 1 0 2 
# 3 2 0 
# Output: 
# 9 
# Explanation: 
# Row 0 → replace 0 with 5 → [5,1,3] → sum = 9 
# Row 1 → replace 0 with 6 → [1,6,2] → sum = 9 
# Row 2 → replace 0 with 7 → [3,2,7] → sum = 12 
# Minimum = 9
