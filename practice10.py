# Question 2) Minimum Cost to Connect All Nodes (Kruskal’s 
# Algorithm) 
# Problem Statement 
# You are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Each edge 
# has a weight. Your task is to find the minimum cost to 
# connect all nodes using Kruskal’s Algorithm. 
# If it is not possible to connect all nodes, return -1. 
 
# Input Format 
# n m 
# u1 v1 w1 
# u2 v2 w2 
# ... 
# um vm wm 
# • n → number of nodes  
 
 
# • m → number of edges  
# • ui, vi → nodes connected  
# • wi → weight of edge  
 
# Output Format 
# minimum_cost 
 
# Example 
# Input 
# 4 5 
# 0 1 10 
# 0 2 6 
# 0 3 5 
# 1 3 15 
# 2 3 4 
# Output 
# 19 
# Explanation 
# Edges chosen: 
# • (2,3) → 4  
# • (0,3) → 5  
# • (0,1) → 10  
# Total = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19 
 
 
 
# Approach 
# • Sort edges by weight  
# • Use Disjoint Set (Union-Find):  
# o Avoid cycles  
# • Pick smallest edges until n-1 edges selected  
# • If less than n-1 edges → return -1
